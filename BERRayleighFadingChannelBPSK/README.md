# BPSK Transmission and Rayleigh Fading Channel Simulation

This MATLAB project simulates Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) signal transmission over a Rayleigh fading channel and analyzes the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. It also includes a neural network-based signal detection approach and theoretical BER comparisons.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive simulation of a digital communication system, covering the following components:

1. **BPSK Modulation and Demodulation**: Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) is used for signal modulation and demodulation.

2. **Rayleigh Fading Channel Simulation**: A Rayleigh fading channel is implemented to model the wireless communication environment, including multipath fading effects.

3. **BER Analysis for Different SNR Values**: The simulation measures the Bit Error Rate (BER) under various Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) to assess system performance.

4. **Neural Network-Based Signal Detection**: A neural network is employed for signal detection and compared to traditional detection methods.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have MATLAB with the Communications System Toolbox installed.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bpsk-rayleigh-fading-simulation.git


## Results

The simulation provides detailed insights into the performance of the communication system:

- **BER Curves**: The project generates BER curves, illustrating how the Bit Error Rate changes with varying SNR values. This allows for the evaluation of the system's robustness in noisy channels.

- **Neural Network Evaluation**: The implementation of a neural network for signal detection is showcased. It demonstrates how machine learning can be used for signal processing tasks in communication systems.

- **Theoretical BER Comparison**: Theoretical BER curves are also provided for comparison. This validates the accuracy of the simulation results against theoretical expectations.


## Configuration

- **Parameter Adjustments**: You can customize simulation parameters such as SNR values, neural network settings, and communication system configurations directly in the MATLAB scripts to tailor the simulation to your specific requirements.
