# Digital Communication MATLAB Code

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating various aspects of digital communication systems. Whether you're studying communication theory, working on research projects, or simply looking to experiment with digital communication concepts, this codebase provides a starting point.

## Features

- **Modulation Schemes**: Implementations of popular modulation schemes like BPSK, QPSK, and more.

- **Channel Modeling**: Simulate different communication channel models, including AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels.

- **Error Analysis**: Tools for calculating Bit Error Rate (BER) and evaluating system performance.

- **Signal Processing**: Signal generation, filtering, and demodulation techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.

3. Explore the code in the `src` directory. Each subfolder may contain specific simulations or experiments.

4. Run MATLAB scripts and functions to simulate digital communication scenarios.

## Usage

- Follow the comments within MATLAB scripts for guidance on how to use each module.

- Customize parameters and input data as needed for your experiments.

- Record and analyze simulation results for your research or educational purposes.
